# Grocery App Architecture Transition

ðŸ›’ Welcome to the Grocery App Architecture Transition! ðŸŽ‰

This repository presents a practical demonstration of transitioning from a Monolithic application to a Microservices Architecture using NodeJS. My primary goal is to provide a detailed understanding of how this transition was accomplished, highlighting the challenges addressed along the way to achieve a robust Microservices Architecture within the NodeJS ecosystem.


# Overview

The shift from a monolithic architecture to a microservices-based one is paramount for enhancing the scalability, flexibility, and maintainability of modern applications. By decomposing the application into smaller, loosely-coupled services, I aim to enhance agility, facilitate independent deployment and scaling of components, and strengthen fault isolation.

## Branches

You can explore the merged code in the main branch. For specific architectural views, you can navigate to the following branches:

- For **Monolithic architecture**, visit the `monolithic` branch.
- For **Microservices architecture**, check out the `microservices` branch.
